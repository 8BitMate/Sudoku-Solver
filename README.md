# Sudoku Solver
This is a simple sudoku solver written in Haskell. It is mainly written so I could experiment using the ST type, and imperative style code in a language that is purely functional at its core. As a result, the code turned out to be somewhat ugly, and kind of a pain to write, but it shows that it is at least possible, even if it maybe should be avoided.
